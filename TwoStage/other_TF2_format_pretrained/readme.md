This is a collection of pretrained models in TF >= 2.0 format.

You may easy check the pretrained models by running the commands below: 

- DCASE 2020 task 1-a (10 classes)

### FCNN-Attention

```shell
python fcnn_att.py
```

### ResNet

```shell
python resnet.py
```

- DCASE 2020 task 1-b (3 classes)

### Mobile V2

```shell
python mobnet.py 
```
